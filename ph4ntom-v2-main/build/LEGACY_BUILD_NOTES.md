# Phantom Demo — Build 132

A demo/LARP wallet UI. Not a real wallet: no keys, no chain, no custody.
Balances are local set dressing; only market prices are real.

## What is here
- `www/` — the built web app (open `index.html`, or `www/phantom-standalone.html` as a single file)
- `App.jsx` — full React source
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` — builds an unsigned **Phantom Demo.ipa** and attaches it to a release

## Build 132 changes
- Up/down colours are now Display-P3 aware. The reference screenshots are P3, so
  values sampled from them rendered dull as sRGB; red is out of sRGB gamut
  entirely. CSS custom properties serve color(display-p3 ...) on wide-gamut
  screens with sRGB fallbacks (#FF0029 / #00EB4B), and the charts, sparklines
  and arrow icons were unified onto the same two colours.
- Explore Markets removed from Home: it now runs holdings -> Perps ->
  Predictions -> Watchlist, matching the app.
- Bump stretched to 4x the reference: handoff at 932ms (tau1 400), settling by
  ~1.4s. Phase 1 is nearly stationary by the handoff, so the lurch is ~16x the
  preceding velocity. Clean (non-refreshing) releases still run tau 100.
- Release is now the real app's exponential decay (tau 100ms, measured 96-103ms
  across three releases) driven imperatively, so dragging never re-renders Home.
- Reproduces the mid-collapse bump: for 233ms the release settles toward a point
  25.6% of the travel above rest, then re-targets to rest and decays again. Only
  on a pull that refreshes, matching its cause (a reflow when data lands).
- Pull-to-refresh retimed against a 60fps capture of the real app: release runs
  600ms on cubic-bezier(.05,.25,.4,1) (halfway ~135ms, 90% ~380ms, long settle),
  and the pull now uses the real iOS rubber band L*d/(d+L), L = 0.55 x viewport
  height, so a hard pull reaches ~230pt instead of hitting a 180pt ceiling.
- Token page: real "Price history unavailable for this time range" empty state
  (line art + sparkles, measured off the app) instead of inventing a chart for a
  token with no price. Holding card now shows symbol + Open pill, value, amount
  and Today's Return; Send/Receive pair; Market Cap and Network rows.
- Pull-to-refresh: no spinner and no loading state. Pulling slides content over
  black with progressive rubber-band resistance (tops out ~173pt, measured off the
  real app frame-by-frame); releasing glides it back over ~520ms on a soft
  decelerate and prices update in place. The screen never blanks.
- Orientation locked to portrait on every path (native Info.plist, web manifest,
  Screen Orientation API, and a CSS counter-rotation fallback for iOS Safari).

## Running the IPA workflow
Actions → *Build Phantom Demo IPA* → **Run workflow**. The IPA lands in the run's
artifacts and in a release tagged `build-126`. It is unsigned, so it needs
sideloading with your own Apple ID.
